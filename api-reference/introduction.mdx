## API Implementation Guide

This documentation outlines the API endpoints that you, as a Zaymo partner, need to implement on your server. Zaymo will make requests to these endpoints to enable in-email purchase functionality for your customers.

## Base URL

You will need to provide Zaymo with the base URL of your API implementation. This is the domain where you'll host these endpoints, for example:

```
https://api.yourdomain.com
```

When Zaymo makes requests to your API, we will append specific paths to your base URL. For example, if your base URL is `https://api.yourdomain.com`, we would make requests to endpoints like:

```
https://api.yourdomain.com/zaymo/upsell
```

All API endpoints in this documentation will follow this pattern, with `/zaymo` as the prefix for all Zaymo-related routes.

## <a id="authentication"></a>Authentication

All API endpoints should be secured. Zaymo will authenticate requests to your API using API keys. You should provide Zaymo with an API key that our system will use when making requests to your endpoints.

### API Key Validation

Your API should validate the API key included in the `Authorization` header of all incoming requests from Zaymo:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PROVIDED_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and implement proper validation. Reject any requests that don't include a valid API key.
</Warning>

### Example Request Authentication Validation

When Zaymo makes a request to your API, it will look something like this:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/zaymo/upsell/add-product \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PROVIDED_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "product_id": "prod_67890",
    "onetime": true
  }'
```

Your API should validate the API key before processing the request.

## Response Format

Your API responses should be returned in JSON format. A typical successful response should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data specific to the endpoint
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, your API should return an appropriate HTTP status code along with a JSON response containing error details:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "A descriptive error message",
    "details": {} // Additional error details when available
  }
}
```

### Recommended Error Codes

| HTTP Status | Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `invalid_request` | The request was malformed or missing required parameters |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Invalid or missing API key |
| 403 | `forbidden` | The API key doesn't have permission to perform the request |
| 404 | `not_found` | The requested resource was not found |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests in a given amount of time |
| 500 | `server_error` | An unexpected error occurred on your server |

## Rate Limits

If you implement rate limiting on your API, please inform Zaymo of your limits so we can optimize our requests accordingly.

## Testing

For testing purposes, we recommend setting up a test user in your system. You can then  the test user's email address in the `email` parameter of our API requestuses.
