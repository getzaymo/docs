# API Reference

Welcome to the Zaymo API reference. This documentation will help you integrate Zaymo's in-email purchase functionality into your systems.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to the following base URL:

```
https://api.zaymo.com/v1
```

## Authentication {#authentication}

All API endpoints are authenticated using API keys. You will receive a unique API key when you partner with Zaymo.

### API Key Authentication

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all requests:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code. All API requests should be made from your server.
</Warning>

### Example Request with Authentication

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.zaymo.com/v1/upsells/add-product \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "cus_12345",
    "product_id": "prod_67890",
    "onetime": true
  }'
```

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. A typical successful response will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data specific to the endpoint
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API will return an appropriate HTTP status code along with a JSON response containing error details:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "A descriptive error message",
    "details": {} // Additional error details when available
  }
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| HTTP Status | Error Code | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `invalid_request` | The request was malformed or missing required parameters |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Invalid or missing API key |
| 403 | `forbidden` | The API key doesn't have permission to perform the request |
| 404 | `not_found` | The requested resource was not found |
| 429 | `rate_limit_exceeded` | Too many requests in a given amount of time |
| 500 | `server_error` | An unexpected error occurred on the Zaymo server |

## Rate Limits

To ensure system stability, the Zaymo API implements rate limiting. The current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 5,000 requests per day per API key

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `rate_limit_exceeded` error code.

## Versioning

The Zaymo API uses versioning in the URL path (e.g., `/v1/`) to ensure backward compatibility. When we make breaking changes, we'll release a new API version while maintaining support for previous versions.

## Testing

For testing purposes, we provide a test environment and test customer profiles. See our [testing guide](/api-reference/testing) for more information.
