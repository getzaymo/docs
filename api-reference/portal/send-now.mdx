## Notes

- This endpoint should create a new order in your system and adjust the subscription schedule accordingly
- The next delivery date should typically be reset based on your subscription rules (e.g., one month from the immediate shipment date)
- Consider implementing a cooldown period to prevent customers from repeatedly requesting immediate shipments
- If billing is separate from shipping, you may need to charge the customer for this immediate order
- Consider sending a confirmation email to the customer with tracking information once the order ships
