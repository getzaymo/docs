## Notes

- Only include subscriptions that were cancelled within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., last 6 months)
- The `available_discounts` array should include any special offers to incentivize reactivation
- For optimal email display, include high-quality but optimized images
- Consider including personalized messaging based on the reason for cancellation, if available
