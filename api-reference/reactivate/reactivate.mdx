## Notes

- This endpoint should reactivate the subscription in your subscription management system
- The next delivery date should be set based on your business rules (typically a few days in the future)
- If products or pricing have changed since cancellation, you may need to update the subscription accordingly
- Consider sending a welcome back email to the customer after successful reactivation
- Track reactivation metrics to measure the effectiveness of your win-back campaigns
