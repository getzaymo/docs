# Testing Your Integration

Before launching your Zaymo integration in production, it's important to thoroughly test all functionality. This guide provides information on our testing environment and test profiles.

## Test Environment

Zaymo provides a dedicated test environment that mirrors our production environment but doesn't process real orders or affect real customer data. Use this environment for all development and testing.

### Test API Base URL

```
https://api-test.zaymo.com/v1
```

### Test API Key

When you partner with Zaymo, you'll receive both a production API key and a test API key. The test API key should be used for all development and testing activities.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TEST_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  Never use your production API key in development or testing environments.
</Warning>

## Test Customer Profiles

To help you test your integration, we provide several test customer profiles with different characteristics:

### Standard Test Customer

```json
{
  "customer_id": "cus_test_12345",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "first_name": "Test",
  "last_name": "Customer"
}
```

### Customer with Active Subscriptions

```json
{
  "customer_id": "cus_test_67890",
  "email": "subscription@example.com",
  "first_name": "Subscription",
  "last_name": "Tester",
  "has_active_subscriptions": true
}
```

### Customer with Cancelled Subscriptions

```json
{
  "customer_id": "cus_test_54321",
  "email": "cancelled@example.com",
  "first_name": "Cancelled",
  "last_name": "Subscriber",
  "has_cancelled_subscriptions": true
}
```

## Test Products

The test environment includes a set of test products you can use for your integration:

| Product ID | Title | Price (cents) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prod_test_12345 | Test Product A | 1995 |
| prod_test_67890 | Test Product B | 2995 |
| prod_test_54321 | Test Product C | 4995 |

## Test Discount Codes

You can use the following discount codes in the test environment:

| Discount Code | Percentage Off | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TEST10 | 10% | Standard 10% discount |
| TEST20 | 20% | Standard 20% discount |
| COMEBACK15 | 15% | Reactivation discount |

## Testing Each Use Case

### Testing Product Upsells

1. Use the Get Products endpoint with a test customer ID
2. Verify that product information is returned correctly
3. Use the Add Product endpoint to add a test product
4. Verify that the product was added successfully

### Testing Portal Functionality

1. Use the Subscription Info endpoint with a test customer ID that has active subscriptions
2. Verify that subscription information is returned correctly
3. Use the Reschedule endpoint to change a delivery date
4. Use the Send Now endpoint to request immediate shipment
5. Verify that both operations complete successfully

### Testing Reactivation

1. Use the List Cancelled Subscriptions endpoint with a test customer ID that has cancelled subscriptions
2. Verify that cancelled subscription information is returned correctly
3. Use the Reactivate endpoint to reactivate a subscription
4. Verify that the subscription was reactivated successfully

## Error Testing

It's important to test error scenarios as well as successful operations:

- Test with invalid customer IDs
- Test with invalid product IDs
- Test with invalid subscription IDs
- Test with invalid discount codes
- Test with missing required parameters
- Test with invalid date formats

## Going Live

1. Review your integration
2. Provide guidance on any necessary adjustments
3. Help you set up your production API key
4. Coordinate the launch timeline
