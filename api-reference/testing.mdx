# Testing Your Integration

Before launching your Zaymo integration in production, it's important to thoroughly test all functionality. This guide provides information on our testing approach and test profiles.

## Integration Testing

Zaymo supports a flexible testing approach that allows you to test your integration using your own development environment. Instead of providing a separate test environment, we recommend implementing a "test mode" in your integration that:

1. Prevents real orders from being processed
2. Doesn't affect real customer data
3. Returns predictable test responses

### Setting Up Your Test Endpoint

When implementing your integration endpoints, we recommend adding a test parameter that you can use to trigger test behavior:

```
https://your-api-endpoint.com/upsells/products?test=true
```

Or using a header:

```bash
X-Zaymo-Test-Mode: true
```

This approach allows you to test the integration without making changes to your production systems.

### API Key

When you partner with Zaymo, you'll receive an API key that can be used for both testing and production. Your integration should determine whether to process a request as a test based on the test parameter, not based on different API keys.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  Ensure your test mode is properly secured to prevent accidental test transactions in production.
</Warning>

## Test Customer Profiles

To help you test your integration, we recommend creating test customer profiles with different characteristics:

### Standard Test Customer

```json
{
  "customer_id": "test_12345",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "first_name": "Test",
  "last_name": "Customer"
}
```

### Customer with Active Subscriptions

```json
{
  "customer_id": "test_67890",
  "email": "subscription@example.com",
  "first_name": "Subscription",
  "last_name": "Tester",
  "has_active_subscriptions": true
}
```

### Customer with Cancelled Subscriptions

```json
{
  "customer_id": "test_54321",
  "email": "cancelled@example.com",
  "first_name": "Cancelled",
  "last_name": "Subscriber",
  "has_cancelled_subscriptions": true
}
```

## Test Products

We recommend creating a set of test products in your system:

| Product ID | Title | Price (cents) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| test_12345 | Test Product A | 1995 |
| test_67890 | Test Product B | 2995 |
| test_54321 | Test Product C | 4995 |

## Test Discount Codes

Create test discount codes in your system:

| Discount Code | Percentage Off | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TEST10 | 10% | Standard 10% discount |
| TEST20 | 20% | Standard 20% discount |
| COMEBACK15 | 15% | Reactivation discount |

## Testing Each Widget

### Testing Product Upsells

1. Implement the Get Products endpoint with test mode
2. Implement the Add Product endpoint with test mode
3. Verify that product information is returned correctly
4. Verify that test purchases complete successfully without affecting production

### Testing Portal Functionality

1. Implement the Subscription Info endpoint with test mode
2. Implement the Reschedule endpoint with test mode
3. Implement the Send Now endpoint with test mode
4. Verify that subscription information is returned correctly
5. Verify that test operations complete successfully without affecting production

### Testing Reactivation

1. Implement the List Cancelled Subscriptions endpoint with test mode
2. Implement the Reactivate endpoint with test mode
3. Verify that cancelled subscription information is returned correctly
4. Verify that test reactivations complete successfully without affecting production

## Error Testing

Test error scenarios in your test environment:
- Invalid customer IDs
- Invalid product IDs
- Invalid subscription IDs
- Invalid discount codes
- Missing required parameters
- Invalid date formats

## Going Live

Once you've thoroughly tested your integration, contact your Zaymo representative to coordinate the transition to production. They will:

1. Review your integration
2. Provide guidance on any necessary adjustments
3. Help you set up for production use
4. Coordinate the launch timeline
