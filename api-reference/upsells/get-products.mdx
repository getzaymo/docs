# Get Products

This endpoint is used to retrieve product information for in-email product blocks. It should return a list of recommended products for in-email upsells. Optionally, if a specific customer's email is provided as a search parameter, the products can be tailored to that customer.

**Parameter Options:**
- If `email` parameter is provided: Returns specific products tailored for that user
- If `email` parameter is not provided: Returns generic products for all customers

## Product Fields

- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product in your system (used with the add-product endpoint)

- **Compare At Price** (optional): Strike through price to be shown with product
- **Images**: Array of one or more image URLs for the product

- Product descriptions should be concise (under 100 characters)
