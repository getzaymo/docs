# Get Products

This endpoint is used to retrieve product information for in-email product blocks. It should return a list of recommended products for in-email upsells. Optionally, if a specific customer's email is provided as a search parameter, the products can be tailored to that customer.

## Product Fields

- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product in your system (used with the add-product endpoint)
- **Title**: Name or title of the product
- **Price**: Price of the product before any discounts (in cents)
- **Compare At Price** (optional): Strike through price to be shown with product
- **Images**: Array of one or more image URLs for the product
- **Description** (optional): Brief description of the product

## Optional Request Parameters

<ParamField path="email" type="string" optional>
  The email address of the customer opening the email.
  
  **Behavior:**
  - If provided: Returns specific product recommendations tailored for that user
  - If not provided: Returns generic product recommendations for all customers
</ParamField>

## Notes

- Images should be optimized for email (recommended size: 600x600px)
- Product descriptions should be concise (under 100 characters)

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.zaymo.com/v1/upsells/products" \

**With Email Parameter (returns specific products for user):**
