## What is Zaymo?

Zaymo enables brands to sell directly within email, creating a frictionless purchasing experience that drives higher conversion rates and increases customer lifetime value. Our in-email purchase functionality allows customers to complete transactions without leaving their inbox, reducing the steps to purchase and eliminating common checkout barriers.
