The Reactivate widget makes it easy for customers to reactivate cancelled subscriptions directly from email.

<Frame caption="Example of subscription reactivation in email">
  <img src="/images/Reactivate.gif" alt="Reactivation example" />
</Frame>

## How It Works

1. Former subscriber receives an email with reactivation offer
2. Customer views their cancelled subscription details
3. Customer clicks to reactivate their subscription, potentially with a special offer
4. Subscription is reactivated without leaving the email

## Required Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Get Cancelled Subscriptions](/api-reference/reactivate/cancelled-subscriptions) | Retrieve cancelled subscription details | Yes |
| [Reactivate Subscription](/api-reference/reactivate/subscription) | Process subscription reactivation | Yes |
