The Reactivate widget makes it easy for customers to reactivate cancelled subscriptions directly from email.

  *Example of subscription reactivation in email*
</Frame>

## How It Works

1. Former subscriber receives an email with reactivation offer
2. Customer views their cancelled subscription details
3. Customer clicks to reactivate their subscription, potentially with a special offer
4. Subscription is reactivated without leaving the email
