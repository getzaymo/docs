The Subscription Portal widget allows subscribers to manage their subscriptions directly from email, including rescheduling deliveries or requesting immediate shipment.

  </Frame>
  **Delay Subscription**
  *Subscribers can postpone their next delivery*
</Card>
<Card>
  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/PortalSendNow.gif" alt="Send now example" />
  </Frame>
  **Send Now**
  *Subscribers can request immediate shipment*
</Card>

## How It Works

1. Subscriber receives an email with subscription management options
2. Subscriber can view current subscription details
3. Subscriber can reschedule their next delivery or request immediate shipment
4. Changes are confirmed without leaving the email
