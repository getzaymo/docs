Zaymo offers several in-email widgets. Each widget can be implemented independently.

## <a id="product-upsells"></a>Product Upsells

The Product Upsells widget allows customers to purchase products or add them to subscriptions directly from an email with just one click, without ever leaving their inbox.

### How It Works

1. Customer receives an email with an embedded product block
2. Customer selects a product and clicks to purchase
3. The product is instantly purchased or added to their subscription
4. Customer receives confirmation without ever leaving their email

### Required Endpoints

| [Get Products](/api-reference/upsells/get-products) | Retrieve product information to display in email | Yes |
| [Add Product](/api-reference/upsells/add-product) | Process the customer's purchase or subscription addition | Yes |

## <a id="subscription portal"></a>Subscription Portal

The Subscription Portal widget allows subscribers to manage their subscriptions directly from email, including rescheduling deliveries or requesting immediate shipment.
